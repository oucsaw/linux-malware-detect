Description: A malware scanner for Linux 
 Linux Malware Detect (LMD) is a malware scanner for Linux released under the
 GNU GPLv2 license, that is designed around the threats faced in shared hosted
 environments. It uses threat data from network edge intrusion detection
 systems to extract malware that is actively being used in attacks and
 generates signatures for detection. In addition, threat data is also derived
 from user submissions with the LMD checkout feature and from malware
 community resources. The signatures that LMD uses are MD5 file hashes and HEX
 pattern matches, they are also easily exported to any number of
 detection tools such as ClamAV.
 .
 The driving force behind LMD is that there is currently limited availability
 of open source/restriction free tools for Linux systems that focus on malware
 detection and more important that get it right. Many of the AV products that
 perform malware detection on Linux have a very poor track record of detecting
 threats, especially those targeted at shared hosted environments.
